My Personal Website and CV

Hello! I am an aspiring Front End Developer who is interested in learning more and challenging myself in all things web design and development. I am comfortable with HTML5, CSS3, JQuery, and WordPress, including some PHP and vanilla JavaScript. I understand git and gulp commands, as well as GitHub for version control. I also enjoy designing templates, interfaces, icons, and other random things, usually in Illustrator or Photoshop. I would like to continue learning more on UI/UX design, smooth animation, and databases.

My CV right now only includes experience in other sectors unrelated to web design. They include copywriting, design, audio/video production, and SEO, among others. This static page is coded by myself in HTML5 an CSS3
